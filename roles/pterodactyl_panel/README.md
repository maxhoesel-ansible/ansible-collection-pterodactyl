# maxhoesel.pterodactyl.pterodactyl_panel

Install and initialize a pterodactyl panel instance.

This role follows the official installation instructions on the pterodactyl [docs homepage](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html).
It will install a webserver (apache2), redis, configure the panel and add an initial admin user (User: `admin`, Password: `admin`, see vars).

It does **not** setup a database for pterodactyl - you will have to supply your own MySQL/MariaDB installation.

Note that this role will not upgrade an existing installation to a newer version. It only installs and configures a panel server.

## Requirements

- The following distributions are currently supported:
  - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer
  - Other Debian-based distros with PHP 7.4 or higher should also work, but are not officially supported
  - There are no plans to support CentOS/RHEL-based distros right now
- You need to supply your own MariaDB/MySQL database. See the role vars below for available parameters
- A SSL certificate + key must already be present on the host. setting up an HTTP only panel is not supported
- This role requires root access. Make sure to run this role with `become: yes` or equivalent
