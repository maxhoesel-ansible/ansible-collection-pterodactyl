This role follows the official installation instructions on the pterodactyl [docs homepage](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html).
It will install a webserver (apache2), redis, configure the panel and add an initial admin user (User: `admin`, Password: `admin`, see vars).

Note that this role will not upgrade an existing installation to a newer version. It only installs and configures a panel server.

  Note that future versions of the panel will require PHP 8.1, which is not yet available on most distros.
- You need to supply your own MariaDB/MySQL database. See the role vars below for available parameters
- A SSL certificate + key must already be present on the host. setting up an HTTP only panel is not supported
