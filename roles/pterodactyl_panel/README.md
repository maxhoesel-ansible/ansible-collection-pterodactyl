# maxhoesel.pterodactyl.pterodactyl_panel

Install and initialize a pterodactyl panel instance in line with the official install instructions.

This role does the following:
- Install `apache2` as the webserver with the distribution-provided (`libapache2-mod-php`) PHP runtime
- Install `redis` for a in-memory cache
- Optionally generate a self-signed certificate or use an existing one
- Install the Pterodactyl Panel using Composer
- Set up an Admin user
- Perform upgrades between panel versions

There's a few things this role does *NOT* do, namely:
- Set up a SQL Database - you can use [another role](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mysql) for this
- Generate a TLS certificate using a service like Lets Encrypt
- Install a PHP version other than the one that comes with your OS
- Allow using a Webserver other than Apache

## Versioning Policy

This role officially supports the Pterodactyl 1.x series releases.
We test against the latest version, as well as the last versions to support older PHP releases.
Other versions are supported on a best-effort basis.

## Requirements

- You need to supply your own MariaDB/MySQL database. See the role vars below for available parameters
- This role requires root access. Make s

### Distribution and PHP

This role supports Debian-based distributions shipping the required apache packages.
Your chosen distro needs to ship with a version of PHP that is compatible with the `pterodactyl_panel_version`.
See the [Pterodactyl Upgrade docs](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/updating.html) for details.
You can find out which version of PHP ships with which distribution [here](https://pkgs.org/download/libapache2-mod-php).
ure to run this role with `become: yes` or equivalent

## Role Variables

### General

##### `pterodactyl_panel_version`
- Version of the panel to install
- Can be a specific tag (e.g. `v1.3.2`) or `latest`
- Note that the panel will automatically update itself if set to `latest`
- Default: `latest`

##### `pterodactyl_panel_webroot`
- Path in which the panel should be installed
- Default: `/var/www/pterodactyl`

### Apache2

##### `pterodactyl_panel_domain`
- Domain for which Apache2 should respond to queries
- Default: `{{ ansible_fqdn }}`

##### `pterodactyl_panel_ssl_mode`
- Determines how the role should handle the TLS certificates for the panel
- If set to `selfsign`, the role creates a self-signed certificate and uses it for the Panel.
  You should only use a self-signed certificate for private use or during testing.
  For production deployments, please use a service like Lets Encrypt to generate a valid certificate.
- If set to `none`, the role does not manage certificates - it just loads an existing server certificate from `pterodactyl_panel_ssl_<cert/key>`.
  You are responsible for providing such a certificate before running the role (for example via Lets Encrypt)
- Default: `none`

##### `pterodactyl_panel_ssl_cert`
- Certificate file for the apache2 webserver
- The behavior depends on `pterodactyl_panel_ssl_mode`:
    - If `none`: This is the certificate read by the role. The file must already be present on the remote host and be readable by `www-data`.
    - If `selfsign`: This is the path where the self-signed certificate will be stored by this role. The directory must already exist.
- Default (depends on `pterodactyl_panel_ssl_mode`):
    - If `none`: `"/etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ pterodactyl_panel_domain }}/fullchain.pem"` (the Let's Encrypt directory)
    - If `selfsign`: `/etc/ssl/panel-selfsign.crt`

##### `pterodactyl_panel_ssl_key`
- Key file for the apache2 webserver
- The behavior depends on `pterodactyl_panel_ssl_mode`:
    - If `none`: This is the key file read by the role. The file must already be present on the remote host and be readable by `www-data`.
    - If `selfsign`: This is the path where the self-signed key will be stored by this role. The directory must already exist.
- Default (depends on `pterodactyl_panel_ssl_mode`):
    - If `none`: `"/etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ pterodactyl_panel_domain }}/privkey.pem"` (the Let's Encrypt directory)
    - If `selfsign`: `/etc/ssl/panel-selfsign.key`

##### `pterodactyl_panel_upload_limit`
- Maximum allowed upload file size for the panel
- Default: `100M`
