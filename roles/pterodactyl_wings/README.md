# maxhoesel.pterodactyl.pterodactyl_wings

Install and initialize the pterodactyl wings daemon

This role follows the official installation instructions on the pterodactyl [docs homepage](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html).

## Requirements

- The following distributions are currently supported:
  - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or newer
  - There are no plans to support CentOS/RHEL-based distros right now
- This role requires root access. Make sure to run this role with `become: yes` or equivalent
- Docker is required to run Wings. If docker is not present, this role will install it automatically
- You must have already created a new node in your panel.

## Role Variables

### General

##### `pterodactyl_wings_version`
- Version of wings to install
- Can be a specific tag (e.g. `v1.3.2`) or `latest`
- Default: latest

##### `pterodactyl_wings_config_dir`
- Directory in which the config file is stored
- Default: `/etc/pterodactyl`

### Docker

##### `pterodactyl_wings_docker_install`
- Whether to handle the docker installation.
- Set to `false` if you already have a docker install running and don't want this role to touch anything
- Default: `true`

##### `pterodactyl_wings_docker_source`
- Method used to install docker
- If set to `distro`, the Docker version provided by the distribution will be installed
- If set to `stable`, the most recent stable version form the official Docker repositories will be installed
- If this value is changed later, the role will automatically switch the installed Docker version. Note that this may cause downtime
- Default: `stable`

### Wings Configuration

The `pterodactyl_wings_config` is a dictionary representing the configuration file of the wings daemon. This configuration
will be merged with any existing configuration already present on the node.

To get started, you can adjust the configuration below. To get a more complete configuration file, use the panel to generate one
or read it from an existing wings daemon.

**NOTE**: You must provide your own uuid, token_id and token values. These can be viewed in the node settings in the panel.

**NOTE**: The TLS certificate for the wings daemon must be present at the supplied path (defaults to Let's Encrypt).

Default configuration:

```yaml
pterodactyl_wings_config:
  debug: false
  # Secrets generated by the panel for the wings client
  uuid: #your-uuid-here
  token_id: #your-token-id-here
  token: #your-token-here
  api:
    host: 0.0.0.0 # Address to bind the wings daemon to
    port: 8080 # Port to bind the wings daemon to
    # SSL Settings, including certificate path and key. Defaults to the path used by certbot/Let's Encrypt
    ssl:
      enabled: true
      cert: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ ansible_fqdn }}/fullchain.pem"
      key: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ ansible_fqdn }}/privkey.pem"
    upload_limit: 100 # File browser upload limit in MB
  remote: https://127.0.0.1:443 # The address of the Panel
  system:
    data: /var/lib/pterodactyl/volumes # Path under which to save server data
    sftp:
      bind_port: 2022 # Port on which sftp should listen on
  allowed_mounts: []
  # add additional configuration options here, if required
```
